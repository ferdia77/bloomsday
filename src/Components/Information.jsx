      <h1>Ulysses aWake Monday June 16 th 2025 6pm for Blackrock Bloomsday</h1>
      <p className="information">
        Ulysses aWake is the play that brings drama, comedy, and music to the
        heart of Blackrock. This year we introduce a new Bloom to the Idrone
        Players’ 18 actors, dancers, and musicians: Mark Aylward from Glasthule,
        a stone’s throw from Sandycove where Joyce’s Ulysses journey begins,
        joins our Players’ portrayal of that journey in 90 fun filled minutes to
        the tune of their original soundtrack, Port na Taibhsí (Jig of the
        Ulysses Ghosts). The original Ghost Star himself, Sweny’s P.J. Murphy,
        leads that jig while Aylward’s Bloom takes us to the heart of his Day.
        The play’s the thing: on its 15 th anniversary the eponymous hero will
        be unmasked. Come early, take a seat, enjoy the convivial atmosphere
        inside the amphitheatre that Blackrock Village Centre becomes for
        Blackrock Bloomsday. All welcome, admission free
      </p>

        Martello Tower event (for the Tower Bloomsday Brochure) Saturday June 14
        th 2025 2pm- 3:30pm

      <p className="information">
        Ulysses aWake’s brand new Bloom hails from Glasthule, just a stone’s
        throw from Sandycove where Joyce’s Ulysses journey starts. Mark Aylward
        joins the jig of the Ulysses ghosts set free at the Tower in the guise
        of the Idrone Players’ 18 actors, singers, dancers, and live musicians.
        They portray Ulysses to the tune of Port na Taibhsí (Jig of the Ulysses
        Ghosts), while Aylward’s Blooms tells us, in plain words (by
        metempsychosis), the truth at the heart of his Day.
